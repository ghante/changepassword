This is a clean Spring MVC application skeleton with Hibernate persistence. I'm building with Gradle and I'm running functional tests with WebDriver.

1. Edit the following files to reflect your environment:
	src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/spring/persistence-config.xml
	src/test/resources/test-persistance-config.xml
2. Run the Selenium test (you will need to have Firefox installed). 
	gradle clean selenium

Done.
